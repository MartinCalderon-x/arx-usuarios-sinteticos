# Test Data Directory
#
# This directory contains test fixtures and sample data for functional tests.
# Unlike data/, this directory IS committed to the repository.
#
# Structure suggestion:
#   data-test/
#   ├── samples/           # Sample files for testing
#   │   ├── documents/     # Sample documents for RAG testing
#   │   ├── images/        # Sample images
#   │   └── fixtures.json  # Test fixtures
#   └── .gitkeep
#
# Usage in tests:
#   from pathlib import Path
#   TEST_DATA = Path(__file__).parent.parent / "data-test"
#   sample_doc = TEST_DATA / "samples" / "documents" / "test.txt"
